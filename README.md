This program is designed to be a simple, lightweight, and easy to implement discord bot. 

Required libraries are 
    - discord
    -openai
    
The slash command is located in main.py on line 41. The program is set to use "/ask" by default to trigger the bot. "ask" can be replaced with whatever you like. 

Input your API keys in the config.py file. Do not share your api keys with anyone. 

I had a bunch of fun doing this and using ChatGPT to help out! Feel free to use this code however you like!
